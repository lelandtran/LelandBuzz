Leland's PhoneBuzz Web Application
Submission for LendUp Coding Challenge

Progress: 
	Phase 1 - complete
	Phase 2 - complete
	Phase 3 - complete
	Phase 4 - view displays phone call logs

The application is hosted on: http://lelandbuzz.herokuapp.com/

To run the web application:
cd path/to/LelandBuzz
java -jar target/LelandBuzz-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Notes: 
-Run it from the LelandBuzz directory so that the jar file can use the application.properties file in the LelandBuzz/config directory as Spring allows. This will create a proper connection to the Postgres database hosted on Heroku
-During testing of Phase 1, the first call to the Twilio phone number after a few hours resulted in a network failure application error. After trying to call again, the call goes through to the TwiML document.
