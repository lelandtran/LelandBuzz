	1. Use Spring MVC to create a webpage (view unimportant for Phase 1)
		a. Webpage will just have a request mapping and a response body
		b. Response body will be
			i. Say: Ask for a number
			ii. Gather: Save the input number
			iii. Say: Depending on the previous Gather, recite FizzBuzz
				 Try to do this programmatically with mods  
	2.
