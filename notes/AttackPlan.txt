Plan of Attack:

Create the app using Spring Boot to make an executable JAR.
For redundancy, try to zip up the relevant files to run as a web application on a Tomcat server.

Phases
	1. Simple PhoneBuzz
		a. Use Spring MVC to create a webpage (view unimportant for Phase 1)
		b. Webpage will just have a request mapping and a response body
		c. Response body will be
			i. Say: Ask for a number
			ii. Gather: Save the input number
			iii. Say: Depending on the previous Gather, recite FizzBuzz
				 Try to do this programmatically with mods  

	2. Dialing PhoneBuzz
		a. Home page displays a form with a textbox and a submit button
		b. sanitize the textbox input
		c. send request to Spring controller which uses twilio rest api
