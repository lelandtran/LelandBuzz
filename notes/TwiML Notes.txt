TWIML Notes

Program Flow:
	1. Client dials Twilio phone number
	2. Twilio sends an HTTP request to the URL associated with that phone number.
	3. Website returns an XML response with a Twilio instruction set.
	4. Twilio interpreter reads through the instruction set until reaching the bottom, at which point, it disconnects the call. 
		a. If a verb element has its "action" attribute set to a URL, the control flow switches to the Response TwiML received from that URL

Twilio.TwiML Helper Library
	"Frees you from having to manually create well-formed XML responses. Instead the libarary provides you with a set of simple methods which you can use to get TwiML elements and attributes"
	To use: 
		1. Import from Maven repository
		2. Create an instance of the TwilioResponse class
		3. Call helper methods like .Say(String s) on the instance
		4. To return, write the instance using toString() to the HTTP Response. Set the ContentType to text/xml.
